/**
 * ======================================
 * UUIDRandom
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 * Creates a numeric universally unique identifier suitable for use as a primary
 * key in FileMaker number fields. The UUID is composed almost entirely of
 * random digits. This may be useful in some situations to preserve the
 * anonymity of the conditions that generated the UUID. The values returned by
 * this and related functions have a one-to-one correspondence with UUIDs
 * following the RFC 4122 standard - all values in the format generated by this
 * function can be converted to RFC 4122, and visa-versa.
 *
 * RETURNS:
 * A 41-digit delimited number of the form:
 * v-r-nnnnnnnnnnnn-nnnnnnn-nnnnn@nnnnnnnnnnnnnnn
 * The sections of the UUID correspond to:
 * v: A UUID version (type) number
 * r: A variant code reserved by the RFC 4122 standard
 * n: Random digits, within certain bounds for compatibility with RFC 4122
 *
 * PARAMETERS: none
 *
 * DEPENDENCIES: none
 *
 * NOTES:
 * For most practical purposes, FileMaker will ignore the text delimiters in
 * values returned by this function.
 *
 * These functions generates UUIDs that are meaningfully sortable. Values sort
 * by version, then creation order, then node (creation device).
 *
 * This function creates a (decimal) numeric UUID, which has performance
 * advantages for file size and find speed in FileMaker. The value can be
 * converted to RFC 4122 canonical form (hexadecimal) with the
 * UUIDGetAsRFC4122 function.
 *
 * HISTORY:
 * MODIFIED on 2011-02-02 by jbante@supportgroup.com to use a format with a
 * one-to-one relationship with UUIDs in RFC 4122 format.
 * CREATED on 2010-12-02 by Jeremy Bante of The Support Group
 * (jbante@supportgroup.com).
