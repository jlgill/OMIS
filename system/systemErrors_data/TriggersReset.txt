/**
 * =====================================
 * TriggersReset
 *
 * PURPOSE:
 * TriggersReset sets global variables to indicate that script triggers should
 * be allowed to run, regardless of any persisting instructions to the contrary
 * from any script. This may be useful to recover from a situation where a
 * script forgot to call TriggersEnable at the end of operation. In order to be
 * suppressed, a script called via trigger should use the TriggersAreActive
 * function to decide whether or not to run.
 *
 * RETURNS: "" (null)
 *
 * PARAMETERS: none
 *
 * REFERENCED VARIABLES:
 * $$~DISABLETRIGGERS
 * $$~DISABLETRIGGERS.SCRIPTS
 *
 * DEPENDENCIES: none
 *
 * HISTORY:
